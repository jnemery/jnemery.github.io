This has sparked quite a bit of curiosity into me as I want to 
know about the product we are soon to be using. What does one do when they want to learn more about a topic? That's easy!
You Google it! Off I go...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"Docker is the world's leading software containerization platform"&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Containerization? I know I've heard of it before, but this is going to take a little more sleuthing to be 100% comfortable
about. After a bit more searching, I found a nice article
&lt;a href="http://www.cio.com/article/2924995/enterprise-software/what-are-containers-and-why-do-you-need-them.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; that
explains that containerization allows you to get software to
run reliably when moved from one environment to the next. 
Containers have everything an application needs to run, which
makes that application able to run on different systems with no
need to worry about differences in Operating Systems. This article
also goes in to talk about the difference between containerization
and virtualization. After more explination than I will go into
here, they explain that a container ends up being about tens of 
megabytes in size, while a virtual machine can end up being 
several gigabytes in size. I feel comfortable moving on from what 
containerization is, so onto more about Docker!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Docker has a nice visual about comparing containers and virtual 
machines! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="VM" src="/images/Docker_VM.png" /&gt; &lt;img alt="Docker" src="/images/Docker_Docker.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From this diagram alone, it seems like virtual machines are much 
more clunky than Docker. I am enjoying what I am seeing so far... &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I should probably be doing homework instead of researching what 
Docker is, so I will call it quits for now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See you next time!&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>My First Post</title><link href="https://jnemery.github.io/my-first-post.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-01-22T16:40:00+01:00</published><author><name>Jennifer Emery</name></author><id>tag:jnemery.github.io,2017-01-22:my-first-post.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;This is my first post!&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry></feed>
